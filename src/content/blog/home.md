Music & Lyrics by Kit Chan and Dick Lee  
  
Whenever I am feeling low  
I look around me and I know  
There's a place that will stay within me  
Wherever I may choose to go  
I will always recall the city  
Know every street and shore  
Sail down the river which brings us life  
Winding through my Singapore  
  
_CHORUS_  
This is home truly  
Where I know I must be  
Where my dreams wait for me  
Where that river always flows  
This is home surely  
As my senses tell me  
This is where I won't be alone  
For this is where I know it's home  
  
When there are troubles to go through  
We'll find a way to start anew  
There is comfort in the knowledge  
That home's about its people too  
So we'll build our dreams together  
Just like we've done before  
Just like the river which brings us life  
There'll always be Singapore  
  
This is home truly  
Where I know I must be  
Where my dreams wait for me  
Where that river always flows  
This is home surely  
As my senses tell me  
This is where I won't be alone  
For this is where I know it's home  
  
_CHORUS_  
This is home truly  
Where I know I must be  
Where my dreams wait for me  
Where that river always flows  
This is home surely  
As my senses tell me  
This is where I won't be alone  
For this is where I know it's home  
  
For this is where I know it's home  
For this is where I know I'm home
