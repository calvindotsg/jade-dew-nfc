Music & Lyrics: Hugh Harrison  

We have a vision for tomorrow, just believe.  
We have a goal for Singapore, we can achieve.  
You and me, we'll do our part, stand together, heart to heart.  
We're going to show the world what Singapore can be!  
We can achieve!  
  
There is something down the road that we can strive for.  
We are told no dream's too bold that we can't try for.  
There's a spirit in the air, it's a feeling we all share.  
We're going to build a better life, for you and me!  
We can achieve!  
  
Count on me Singapore, count on me to give my best and more.  
You and me, we'll do our part, stand together, heart to heart.  
We're going to show the world what Singapore can be!  
We can achieve!  
  
Chorus:  
Count on me, Singapore,   
Count on me to give my best and more,  
Count on me, Singapore.  
  
Together, Singapore!
