Composed by Jeremy Monteiro, with lyrics written by Jim Aitchison  

We've built a nation with our hands  
The toil of people from a dozen lands  
Strangers when we first began, now we're Singaporean  
Let's reach out for Singapore, join our hands forevermore  
  
One people, one nation, one Singapore  
That's the way that we will be forevermore  
Every creed and every race, has its role and has its place  
One people, one nation, one Singapore  
  
And when the time comes for the test  
Our vigilance will never rest  
We'll be united, hand in hand  
We'll show the world just where we stand  
And reach out for Singapore, join our hands forevermore  
  
One people, one nation, one Singapore  
That's the way that we will be forevermore  
Every creed and every race, has its role and has its place  
One people, one nation, one Singapore  
  
One people, one nation, one Singapore  
That's the way that we will be forevermore  
Every creed and every race, has its role and has its place  
One people, one nation, one Singapore  
  
One people, one nation, one Singapore
