Stand up for Singapore  
Do the best you can  
Reach out for your fellow man  
You've got to make a stand  
Recognise you can play your part  
Let it come right from your heart  
Be prepared to give a little more  
Stand up, stand up for Singapore.  
  
Stand up for Singapore  
Do it with a smile  
If you stand up for Singapore  
You'll find it all worthwhile  
Believe in yourself  
You've got something to share;  
So show us all you really care  
Be prepared to give a little more  
Stand up, stand up for Singapore  
  
Singapore our home and nation  
Together with determination  
Join in like we've never done before  
Stand up, stand up for Singapore,  
Stand up, stand up for Singapore,  
Stand up, stand up for Singapore.
