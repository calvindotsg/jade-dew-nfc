_Verse 1 : Linying_  
One man on an island  
One drop in the sea  
All it takes to set a wave in motion

Is a single word, an action  
A hope that we can be  
The change that we’ve been longing to see

_Pre-Chorus: Linying_  
For our home, our land, our family  
It’s all within our reach

_Chorus: Linying_  
See this island, every grain of sand  
Hear this anthem, it’s the voices of our friends  
Come whatever on the road ahead  
We did it before, and we’ll do it again

_Verse 2: Sezairi_  
When the moments turn to hours  
And the day’s last light is gone  
Look around us always and remember

There were times we were uncertain  
But we just kept walking on  
It’s always darkest just before the dawn  
See upcoming pop shows  
Get tickets for your favorite artists

_Chorus 2: Linying & Sezairi_  
See this island, every grain of sand  
Hear this anthem, it’s the voices of our friends  
Come whatever on the road ahead  
We did it before, and we’ll do it again

_Bridge: Shye_  
Our home, the home we share  
Where the garden always grows toward the light  
Though the road ahead is daunting  
I know we’re gonna be alright

_Chorus 3: Shabir_  
See this island, every grain of sand  
Hear this anthem, it’s the voices of our friends  
Come whatever on the road ahead  
We did it before, and we’ll do it again

_Chorus 4: Linying, Sezairi, Shye & Shabir_  
See this island, every grain of sand  
Hear this anthem, it’s the voices of our friends  
Come whatever on the road ahead  
We did it before, and we’ll do it again
