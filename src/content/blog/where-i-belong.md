Music & Lyrics by Tanya Chua  

_Verse 1_  
Morning comes around and I can’t wait to see,  
My sunny island.  
In its glorious greenery wether rain or shine,  
Its still, beautiful.  
Bright lights shine on the streets at night,  
Guiding me, closer to home,  
To a place where I’ll be safe and warm,  
Where I belong.  
  
_Verse 2_  
Friends and families by my side seeing me through,  
As I grow and learn.  
Everyday’s experience bitter, sweet or sour,  
They’re still, wonderful.  
As they become precious memories they’ll be kept,  
Close to my heart.  
And no matter where I am, I will always know,  
Where I belong…  
  
_Chorus_  
Where I belong, where I keep my, heart and soul.  
Where dreams come true for us,  
Where we walk to together hand in hand,  
Towards, the future so bright  
Where I belong, where I keep my, heart and soul,  
Where we are one big family,  
  
_Outro_  
I want the whole world to know, I want to shout it out loud,  
That this is where I know I belong.  
  
_Chorus_  
Where I belong, where I keep my, heart and soul.  
Where dreams come true for us,  
Where we walk to together hand in hand,  
Towards, the future so bright  
Where I belong, where I keep my, heart and soul,  
Where we are one big family,  
  
_Outro_  
I want the whole world to know, I want to shout it out loud,  
That this is where I know I belong.  
  
_Outro_  
I want the whole world to know, I want to shout it out loud,  
That this is where I know I belong.
