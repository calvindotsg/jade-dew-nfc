# Not Alone

Music & Lyrics by Benjamin Kheng & Evan Low

_VERSE 1_

How do I reach for the skies
If I’m feeling low,
Don’t know where to go
How do I stand when it’s time
When spirits are high
And flags are flying

_PRE-CHORUS 1_

But then I come to the river
That runs through my town
Where our fathers and mothers
have watered the ground
And the roads I have walked
And the faces I know
Oh I know, I know

_CHORUS_

If we just look to each other
Then this house will feel like home
And the more we’re together the further we’ll go
You and I we’re Not alone '
Not Alone
(You and I we’re, not alone yeah)

_VERSE 2_

[CALL]
How do I know I belong? 

[RESPONSE]
We’ll find love for
Every creed and colour
If we lean on one another

[CALL]
How will I ever get there?
All I know is

[RESPONSE]
You and me do better
When we run together

_PRE-CHORUS 2_

But then I come to the river
and fears start to fade
my brothers and sisters
we journey the same
And I know, I know

_BRIDGE_

Just one ripple in a river
Can be the one to turn the tide
When the water rises
I'll be right by your side

_FINAL VERSE_

And if they ask of my home
When I'm miles apart
I'll think of the people I hold in my heart
The family I found, and the faces I know
I know, I know
