_Verse 1_  
There was a time when people said  
That Singapore won't make it, but we did  
There was a time when troubles seemed too much  
For us to take, but we did  
We built a nation, strong and free, reaching out together  
For peace and harmony

_Chorus 1_  
This is my country, this is my flag  
This is my future, this is my life  
This is my family, these are my friends  
We are Singapore, Singaporeans

_Verse 2_  
Singapore our homeland, it's here that we belong  
All of us united, one people marching on  
We've come so far together  
Singapore forever, a nation strong and free

_Chorus 1_  
This is my country, this is my flag  
This is my future, this is my life  
This is my family, these are my friends  
We are Singapore, Singaporeans

_Bridge_  
We the citizens of Singapore  
Pledge ourselves as one united people  
Regardless of race, language or religion  
To build a democratic society  
Based on justice and equality  
So as to achieve happiness  
Prosperity and progress for our nation

_Chorus 2_  
We are Singapore, we are Singapore  
We will stand together, hear the lion roar  
We are Singapore, we are Singapore  
We're a nation strong and free forevermore  
We are Singapore, we are Singapore  
We will stand together, hear the lion roar  
We are Singapore, we are Singapore  
We're a nation strong and free forevermore  
(This is my country, this is my flag) We are Singapore, we are Singapore  
(This is my future, this is my life) We will stand together, hear the lion roar  
(This is my family, these are my friends) We are Singapore, we are Singapore  
We are Singapore, Singaporeans  
We are Singapore, Singaporeans
